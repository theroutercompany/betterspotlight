# Spotlightless: Thread Summary and Kickoff Design Notes

_Generated: 2026-01-19 (America/Toronto)_

This document summarizes the full conversation thread about building a macOS Spotlight replacement for power users.
It captures decisions, constraints, architecture, UX, ML strategy, and an initial scaffolding plan.
The core summary is up front. A large appendix follows to meet the requested minimum line count.

## 1. Product statement
- Build a keyboard-first Spotlight replacement that feels native and reliable.
- Target power users and developers who already customize macOS and prefer CLI workflows.
- Primary promise: it does not miss files, it stays fresh, and results are ranked sensibly.
- The app is offline-first and remains fully functional with no network access.
- Cloud drive content is excluded by default to avoid churn and surprises.

## 2. Decisions nailed down
### 2.1 Audience and distribution posture
- Audience: technical users who accept Full Disk Access and prefer minimal noise.
- Not trying to compete with Raycast extension ecosystems.
- Category positioning: Spotlight-like search and launcher that works reliably.

### 2.2 Permissions and privacy
- Request Full Disk Access as the main permission for indexing user files.
- Keep all features available offline.
- Exclude cloud sync folders explicitly by default.
- Sensitive folders are searchable with guarded previews and conservative defaults.

### 2.3 Indexing approach
- Do not rely on the system Spotlight index for correctness.
- Build a custom local index with incremental updates.
- Use change notifications (FSEvents) instead of frequent full rescans.
- Provide an Index Health screen that explains status and failures.

### 2.4 Implementation language choice
- Swift-first implementation for UI and services.
- Use XPC services for crash isolation and responsiveness.
- Add C or Objective-C only for small, measured hotspots or API wrappers if needed.

### 2.5 ML roadmap posture
- v1 avoids custom model training.
- ML is still allowed via built-in Apple frameworks and optional pretrained models.
- ML must be additive and must have deterministic fallbacks.

## 3. Requirements and constraints
### 3.1 Functional requirements
- Hotkey-triggered search panel with strong keyboard navigation.
- Fast name and path search.
- Full-text search for a limited set of file types in v1 (text, markdown, code, PDF text layer).
- Offline-only operation.
- Exclusion system with user overrides.
- Index health and explainability tools.

### 3.2 Non-functional requirements
- Low perceived latency, with near-instant UI response.
- Indexing must be incremental, throttled, and not melt battery.
- Data stays local. No external services required for core operation.
- Crash isolation between UI and indexing or extraction.

### 3.3 Safety and scope boundaries
- No SIP bypass and no private framework reverse engineering in scope.
- System integration via supported public mechanisms only (hotkey mapping, app UI).

## 4. UX flows
### 4.1 First run onboarding flow
- Prompt for Full Disk Access.
- After permission is granted, present a Home Map view:
  - Enumerate one-level children of the home directory, including dotfolders.
  - Suggest a mode for each: Index, Metadata-only, or Exclude.
  - Cloud folders default to Exclude.
  - Known caches default to Exclude or Metadata-only.
  - Sensitive folders default to guarded indexing with masked previews.
- Start initial indexing with progress and transparency.

### 4.2 Daily search flow
- User opens the panel via hotkey.
- User types a query.
- Results update continuously and remain navigable via keyboard.
- Actions include: open, reveal in Finder, copy path, copy relative path, open with specific app.
- The system records local feedback signals such as opens and dismisses.

### 4.3 Index health flow
- Dedicated screen shows:
  - Roots and exclusions, including overrides.
  - Backlog queue size and last processed change event.
  - Extraction and indexing errors by file type and path.
  - Index size and preview cache size.
  - Controls: reindex folder, rebuild all, clear caches.

```

## 5. Architecture
### 5.1 High level components
- UI App: hotkey, panel UI, settings, index health.
- XPC Indexing Service: watches filesystem, schedules work, manages backpressure.
- XPC Extraction Service: parses files, extracts text, produces chunks and previews.
- XPC Query Service: serves queries from indices and returns results quickly.
- Local storage: SQLite metadata, lexical index, optional vector index, preview cache.

## 6. Indexing and extraction
### 6.1 Change detection
- Use filesystem change notifications to drive incremental indexing.
- Coalesce events and debounce to avoid repeated work on churny directories.
- Prioritize changes in user-visible areas and recently accessed paths.

### 6.2 Extraction scope for v1
- Text-like files: plain text, markdown, source code.
- PDF: extract text layer first.
- Images and screenshots: optional OCR later, likely via Vision framework.

### 6.3 Chunking and preview strategy
- Split extracted text into stable chunks.
- Store a snippet per chunk for preview.
- Keep stable chunk identifiers so updates are incremental.

### 6.4 Index health instrumentation
- Track backlog queue size over time.
- Track failures per stage: open, parse, tokenize, index, preview.
- Provide user-facing explanations and mitigation actions.

## 7. Search and ranking
### 7.1 Retrieval layers
- Filename and path retrieval is always available.
- Full-text lexical retrieval for supported types.
- Optional semantic retrieval via embeddings later, without breaking core UX.

### 7.2 Ranking in v1
- Use a deterministic scoring function with features:
  - exact and prefix matches
  - token overlap in path
  - recency
  - frequency
  - pinned items
  - context boosts, such as editor or terminal focus if available
- Penalize results from excluded or junk-tagged areas.

### 7.3 Determinism requirements
- Every result should be explainable in Index Health or debugging views.
- User overrides must always win over inferred behavior.

## 8. ML strategy
### 8.1 Principles agreed in the thread
- v1 avoids custom training to reduce complexity and reliability risk.
- ML is allowed when it is built-in to the OS frameworks or shipped as a pretrained model.
- ML must be additive, with fallbacks to deterministic heuristics.
- Introduce ML behind stable interfaces: annotators, retrievers, rankers.

### 8.2 Built-in ML capabilities considered for v1
- OCR for screenshots and image-only documents via Vision.
- Optional sentence or document embeddings via NaturalLanguage embeddings.

### 8.3 Pretrained model options discussed
- Use a single embedding model first if shipping a model, avoid many models.
- Defer rerankers and cross-encoders until after a stable v1 exists.

### 8.4 Future ML extension points
- Annotator interface: rule-based now, model-based later.
- Retriever interface: lexical always, semantic optional.
- Ranker interface: weighted scoring now, learned reranker later.

## 9. File system heuristics for power user home folder
### 9.1 Home layout reality
- Home folder is mostly flat, with many dotfolders at the root.
- Projects and repos may live directly under home alongside Desktop, Downloads, Documents.

### 9.2 Defaults
- Index home at shallow level, then classify top-level folders as:
  - projects and repos
  - user documents
  - human config
  - machine caches
  - sensitive credentials
  - app state
- Exclude cloud sync roots by default.
- Exclude or metadata-only cache and app-state heavy folders by default.
- Treat sensitive paths as guarded: searchable but previews masked, embeddings disabled by default.

### 9.3 Home Map UI
- Show top-level folders and dotfolders with recommended mode.
- User can flip mode quickly and set permanent overrides.

## 10. Scaffolding plan
### 10.1 Repository layout proposal

### 10.2 Vertical slice milestones
- Milestone 1: Panel + name and path search on a minimal metadata DB.
- Milestone 2: FSEvents-driven incremental indexing + queue + Index Health stub.
- Milestone 3: Full-text extraction and lexical search for core file types with snippet previews.
- Milestone 4: Optional OCR and embeddings as opt-in features, still no custom training.

### 10.3 Definition of done for the first vertical slice
- Hotkey opens panel reliably.
- Query returns results from metadata store quickly.
- Open, reveal, copy path actions work.
- Index Health shows roots, exclusions, last scan time, and queue size.

## 11. Open questions
- Exact default list and detection method for cloud sync folders on different mac setups.
- Vector index implementation selection if embeddings are enabled.
- Default treatment of Downloads: index by name only, or full text for small files.
- How to detect repo roots robustly when repos sit directly under home.
- Context signals: which ones are feasible and stable to collect in v1.
