THIS FILE HAS AN ALL-CAPS FILENAME AND EXTENSION.

Testing case sensitivity in:
- Filename matching (case-insensitive by default)
- Extension classification (.TXT should be treated as .txt)
- FTS5 search (unicode61 is case-insensitive)
- Path comparison and deduplication

macOS (APFS) is case-insensitive by default, so ALLCAPS.TXT and allcaps.txt
would be the same file. BetterSpotlight must handle this correctly to avoid
duplicate index entries.
