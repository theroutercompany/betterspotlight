This file uses underscores in its name.

Underscores are common in:
- snake_case naming conventions (Python, Ruby, C)
- System and configuration files
- Generated filenames
- Database exports (table_name_2024_01_15.csv)

Testing considerations:
- FTS5 unicode61 tokenizer treats underscores as word characters by default
- This means "file_with_underscores" is one token, not three
- Important for search: query "file" should NOT match via FTS5
- But filename substring matching should still find it
