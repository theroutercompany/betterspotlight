This file uses dashes (hyphens) in its name.

Dashes are common in:
- kebab-case naming conventions
- Date-stamped files (2024-01-15-meeting-notes.txt)
- Slug-style web content filenames
- Package names (sqlite-swift, better-spotlight)

Testing considerations:
- FTS5 tokenizer behavior with hyphens (word boundary or not?)
- unicode61 tokenizer treats hyphens as separators by default
- Filename matching: "file-with" should match prefix search
