This file has spaces in its name to test path handling.

Spaces in filenames are common on macOS, especially in:
- ~/Library/Application Support/
- ~/Documents/My Documents/
- Files saved from web browsers
- Files created by non-technical users

BetterSpotlight must handle these correctly in:
- FSEvents callbacks (paths are C strings)
- SQLite storage and queries
- FTS5 filename tokenization
- XPC message serialization
- Shell command escaping (if any)
