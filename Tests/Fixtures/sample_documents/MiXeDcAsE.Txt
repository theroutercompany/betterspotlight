This file has mixed case in both the name and extension.

Testing case handling throughout the pipeline:
- Extension normalization: .Txt -> .txt for classification
- Filename indexing: "MiXeDcAsE" in the items table
- Search matching: query "mixedcase" should find this file
- Display: original casing should be preserved in results

Unicode case folding is more nuanced than ASCII:
- German eszett: ß -> SS (but SS -> ss, not ß)
- Turkish dotless i: ı vs I
- The unicode61 FTS5 tokenizer handles these cases
