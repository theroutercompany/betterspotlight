This file has an unusually long filename to test how BetterSpotlight handles
edge cases in path processing, display truncation, and filename matching.

The filename is 68 characters long (excluding the extension), which exceeds
typical filename lengths of 20-30 characters. This tests:

1. Path storage in SQLite (TEXT column, no length limit)
2. Filename extraction and indexing
3. FTS5 tokenization of long filenames
4. UI truncation in search results
5. FSEvents path handling
