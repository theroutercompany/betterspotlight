# React Hooks Guide

Hooks simplify state and side-effect logic in function components.
useState is ideal for local UI state.
useEffect coordinates side effects like subscriptions and fetches.
You can package reusable behavior with custom hooks.

## Example patterns
- Data fetching with loading state
- Keyboard listener cleanup
- Persisting preference values

## Cautions
Avoid stale closures by using dependency arrays carefully.
Prefer small focused hooks over monolithic hook files.
