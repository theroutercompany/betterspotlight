# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning models infer patterns from training data.
A neural network can model complex nonlinear relationships.
Optimization often relies on gradient descent.

## Typical workflow
1. Gather and clean data
2. Split into train and validation sets
3. Train baseline model
4. Evaluate and iterate

## Common pitfalls
- Data leakage
- Overfitting
- Unbalanced labels

Good experiment tracking is essential for reproducibility.
