# MyApp

MyApp is a small development playground used by BetterSpotlight fixture tests.
It includes mixed-language sources to exercise extraction and ranking behavior.

## Getting Started
1. Install toolchains for C++, Python, Node.js, Go, and Rust.
2. Run `make build`.
3. Run `make test`.

## Project Layout
- `src/` source code
- `tests/` test files
- `docs/` architecture and deployment notes

## Development Notes
Use predictable filenames so query fixtures remain deterministic.
Avoid random generated content in committed fixtures.
