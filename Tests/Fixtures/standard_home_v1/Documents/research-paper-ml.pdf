Paper: Efficient Retrieval Augmentation for Desktop Search
Authors: Internal Research Group

Abstract
We evaluate retrieval quality under constrained local compute.
The study compares lexical retrieval, semantic retrieval, and hybrid scoring.

Method
A controlled corpus with deterministic content is indexed in SQLite FTS5.
Semantic vectors are generated with quantized embedding models.

Results
Hybrid retrieval outperforms lexical-only systems on conceptual tasks.
Latency remains acceptable with bounded candidate expansion.

Conclusion
High-precision lexical matching should be preserved.
Semantic scoring should augment, not replace, deterministic ranking.
