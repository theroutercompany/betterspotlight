# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Search Infrastructure Engineer role.
I have built local-first indexing and ranking systems with strict privacy goals.
My experience includes designing resilient extraction pipelines and relevance tests.

At BetterSpotlight, I implemented deterministic fixtures for relevance scoring.
This work reduced regressions and improved confidence in model-assisted ranking.
I also partnered with product and QA to design measurable quality gates.

I value clear ownership, transparent metrics, and rapid iteration with safeguards.
I would bring this approach to your platform team.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Rex Liu
